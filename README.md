Description of a creative solution to the issue identified.

The purpose of this smart medical assistant robot is to provide additional support to healthcare providers, improve the quality of care, and increase access to healthcare services thereby acting as medical consultant to determine to the type of diseases the patient is suffering from and again prescribe the needed medicine for the disease. This robot will be programmed with different disease datasets, face and mood detection, speech recognition, text-to-speech, neural networks and other resources so it will be completely autonomous.
The ORION AI robot will be provided the database of the hospital in order to access patientsâ€™ medical folders and update it with whatever it analyses about the patient. The robot will check the temperature of patients at a specified distance, body pulse, blood pressure and others. ORION AI will be provided internet access in order to search anything in case asked by the Doctor.
Overall, it aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare services while reducing costs and increasing access to care, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for patients.
